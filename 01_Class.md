## Mixture and Proportion

**Question :** 
1. If volume of two container is same and in the first and second container ratio of fruit bear and old monk is $2:3$ and $3:4$. Mix all the juices to a big container. Then what will be the proportion of fruit bear and old monk in the bigger container.

*Solution :* Let $x$ be the volume of two container as we can think that ratio of their volumes be $1:1$. Now, in the first container we have $\frac{2x}{2+3}$ and in second container we have $\frac{3x}{3+4}$ fruit bear. In first container we have $\frac{3x}{2+3}$ and in the second container we have $\frac{4x}{3+4}$ old monk. So, after mixing in the larger container we have $\frac{2x}{5}+\frac{3x}{7}=\frac{29x}{35}$ lit. fruit bear and $\frac{3x}{5}+\frac{4x}{7}=\frac{41x}{35}$ lit. old monk. Then ratio of fruit bear and old monk in the new bigger container is : $\frac{29x}{35}:\frac{41x}{35}=29:41$.

### Try the following question:
**Exercise:** Let three container of volume in ratio $1:4:2$ and let in first conatiner, second and third container we have a mixture of old monk, fruit bear and sperm in the ratio $1:2:3$, $2:3:4$, $4:5:6$. Pour the content of all three containers into a bigger container. What will be the ratio of old monk, fruit bear and sperm?

**Answer:** $(\frac{1}{1+2+3} \times 1)+(\frac{2}{2+3+4} \times 4)+(\frac{4}{4+5+6}\times 2):
(\frac{2}{6}\times 1)+(\frac{3}{9}\times 4)+(\frac{5}{15}\times 2):
(\frac{3}{6}\times 1)+(\frac{4}{9}\times 4)+(\frac{6}{15}\times 2)$
